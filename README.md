# Bootstraps-portfolio

Kristen's Website has an about me section on her home page. You can also find how to contact her, links to Linkden in, and can get to her portfolio link to her GitHub assignment, "Bootstraps-portfolio". I have designed this website to help navigate to her projects and contact. Feel free to reach out to her if you have any issues getting into any links, if you find a bug or if you would like her to make your website! (= (After more practice of course!)
